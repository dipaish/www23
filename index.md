## What is HTML?
**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for documents that are designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells browser how to structure a web page. HTML is made up of sereis of **elements** such as a piece of text, a pragraph, , list, table, links or forms.

***Lets write the following line of text in a text file and save it as*** **file1.html** 

```html
I am learning to develop web pages
```

*** Now lets use the paragraph tag by modifying*** **file1.html**
```html
<p>I am learning to develop web pages.</p>
```

>> Note: Tags in HTML are case-insensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. However, it is strongly recommended to write all tags in lowercase for consistency, readability, and other reasons.

***A simple HTML document looks like this***
```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
     <head>
      <title>My page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
      <h1>My page</h1>
      <p>This is a <a href="link">simple</a> Link</p>
      <!-- this is a comment -->
     </body>
    </html>
```   
| Tag  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ```<!DOCTYPE html>```  | It is simply meant to act as links to a set of rules tht the HTML page had to follow. In current time, rarerly anyone cares about it however it is recommended to start with the DOCTYPE.   |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
