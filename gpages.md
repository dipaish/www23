## Semantic Elemets in HTML
Semantics describes the meaning of a piece of code in a human and machine-readable way. By just looking into the code you can easily know the purpose and role of the HTML element.

Elements such as ```<header>, <footer> and <article>``` are **semantic** because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and also the content of the element. **Semantic elements** enhance the readability and accessibility of the HTML code whereas **non semantic elemenets** such as ```<div> <span>``` doest not describe any thing about the content.
